_Wow! You found my GitHub Page. Usually I'm its only visitor._

It's just a quick way to access my repos and gists on GitHub.   
I wrote this while starting to learn [AngularJS](https://www.angularjs.org/).

So it might not be much, but I still use it to ...
- filter and access my repos and gists
- quickly visit repos I forked from
- as my browser's homepage

You can do the same with your GitHub stuff by forking this repo and naming it `<yourUsername>.github.io`.   
Changes to the `README.md` directly reflect on the contents of this About page you are reading.
So you might consider to make this _about you :)_

Maybe you want to read more about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) first.
